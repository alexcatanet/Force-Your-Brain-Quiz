## #Quiz App

This Quiz App project was a chance for me to combine and practice everything I've learned in the Nanodegree program (Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program).

The goal was to create an **educational app** that quizzes a user about a certain topic at my choice. I tried to be creative as it was possible at that moment.

During the development of this project, I have used next IDE tools:

1. For Editing and Cleaning the Sound -- Adobe Audition CC 2018.

2. For Producing the Sound -- FL Studio 2016 (64Bit).

3. For Editing the Pictures -- Adobe Photoshop CC 2018.


This project is about combining various ideas and skills I've been practicing throughout the course. They include:

- Planning my app design before coding.

- Taking an app layout from drawing to XML code.

- Creating, positioning, and styling views.

- Creating interactivity through button clicks and Java code.

- Commenting and documenting the code.


1. Overall Layout -- App contains 11questions, it includes 9 radio buttons, one checkbox and one text entry.

2. Submit button -- App includes a button for the user to submit their answers and receive a score.

3. Rotation -- The app gracefully handles displaying all the content on screen when rotated.

4. Grading Button Function -- The grading button displays a toast which accurately displays the results of the quiz.

5. Grading Logic -- The grading logic checks each answer correctly. The app accurately computes the number of correct answers and does not include incorrect answers in the count.
